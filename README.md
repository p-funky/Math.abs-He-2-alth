# How To Run
- Download or clone the repo
- If downloaded, unzip the zipped file
- In your terminal, navigate to the directory of the cloned/downloaded repo
- run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` or `npx cypress open` (this opens a Cypress window)
- Click on `E2E Testing`
- Click on `Start E2E Testing in Chrome` (this opens the Chrome browser)
- Click on whichever test you want to run e.g. `contact-form.spec.cy.js`

### Assumptions
- This test suite assumes you have previously installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system. If you haven't, you can download them from the official Node.js website(https://nodejs.org/).
- This test suite also assumes you are interested in tests run on a laptop e.g. a Macbook-13 (1280 by 800) and hence does not cater to mobile device screens and the like.
